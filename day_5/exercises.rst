Exercise 01
-----------

Create a module/library containing convenient functions involving 
Atomic Symbol, Atomic name, Atomic Number and Atomic radii. Which functions
do you think might be useful to have? ensure to cover those cases. 


Exercise 02
-----------

Refactor the following snippet so that instead of only printing a 3x3 board
it is possible to print any NxM board

.. code:: python 
   
   print("+---+---+---+")
   print("|   |   |   |")
   print("+---+---+---+")
   print("|   |   |   |")
   print("+---+---+---+")
   print("|   |   |   |")
   print("+---+---+---+")


Exercise 03
-----------

Write a code that allows two players to play a game of tic tac toe in the 
console.


Exercise 04
-----------

Write a python library to do matrix operations. Specifically it should 
allow the user to easily do the following operations: 

*  Add two matrices together
*  Add a number to all elements of the matrix
*  Multiply two matrices together
*  Multiply a matrix by an integer
*  Substract two matrices
*  Substract a number to all elements of the matrix
*  Divide all elements of a matrix by a number
*  Assign a value to an specific element of the matrix
*  Assign the same value to all elements of a row in the matrix
*  Assign the same value to all elements of a column in the matrix
*  Transpose a matrix
*  Compute the determinant of a matrix
*  create a matrix
*  extract a row of a matrix
*  extract a column of a matrix
*  extract the value of a single element of a matrix
*  flatten a matrix
*  reshape a matrix

Exercise 05
-----------

Use the module created in exercise 04 to: 

* Create a 3x3 matrix with the values 1,2,3,4,
  5,6,7,8,9 in whatever order you prefer. 
* Create a 5x5 identity matrix
* add together all the elements of a matrix
