Exercise 01
-----------

Write a class that allows to easily play a game of tic tac toe in the 
console. You can re-factor the code that you wrote on the exercises 02 and 03
of Day_5

Exercise 02
-----------

Rewrite the library of Exercise 04 of Day_5 to use a Matrix class instead of
the assumed representation of a matrix 

Exercise 03
-----------

Update the code of Exercise 05 of Day_5 to use the new version of the library: 

Exercise 04
-----------

Write a class to represent a directed graph. Graphs have nodes and edges, each 
edge has a starting node and a final node and each node has a label. A graph 
may have a "current_node" and the methods to set the current node as well 
as to change it.

The resulting code should be capable of listing all nodes that are exactly
at n steps of a given node. For example graphs you can go to the 61th slide
(before the last one) of the Day_4 presentation. 

Exercise 05
-----------

Create a class to represent the hanoi towers, to provide a suitable 
representation in the console (see below for an example), to carry out 
the movements and raise a Value errors if a movement is not valid with 
a proper message. The class should have a method "solve" which should 
return all the movements necessary and if an optional argument, 
i.e. "enable_print", is provided it will the console representation of the
towers at each step towards the solution.
